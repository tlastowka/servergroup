Windows installation

Install or upgrade to Virtualbox 5.0 
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Install the corresponding Virtualbox extension pack for 5.0
it comes from the same place
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

it works with 4.3.30+ too if you have that already



Install or upgrade to vagrant 1.7.4
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

install git bash 2.5.1 or higher
https://git-for-windows.github.io/

From the start menu, run git bash

go to the directory you want to run from and clone the repo

> cd /whatever/dir/you/want
> git clone <reponame>

> cd servergroup
> cd master
> vagrant up
wait while vagrant does its thing.  if virtualbox asks you to install a driver click yes.

when its done you'll have a mysql master that you can reach at 10.0.11.20

now switch to slave1

> cd ../slave1
> vagrant up

you now have a slave at 10.0.11.31

> cd ../slave2
> vagrant up

you now have another slave at 10.0.11.32

> cd ../slave3
> vagrant up

you now have a third slave at 10.0.11.33

to stop one of them, switch to its directory and type

> vagrant halt

to delete the vm

> vagrant destroy -f
